Cape Town - The City of Cape Town has reopened another three beaches after a number of them had to be closed due to sewage-related problems. The latest to close temporarily is a section of Gordon’s Bay beach, between the walkway and area in front of Spur, due to a sewer overflow. Strand Beach and Small Bay in Blaauwberg were reopened on Tuesday after water sampling results showed their water quality was within the minimum requirement for recreational activities. On Wednesday a part of Fish Hoek beach, the main bathing area section between the lifeguard station and Jager Walk, was also reopened. The City said these parts of these three beaches were closed as a precautionary measure on January 1 due to sewage-related issues which were being attended to.  “The temporary closure at Fish Hoek beach was due to a sewer overflow caused by a blocked sewer pipe that was cleared. Items such as plastics and materials were removed from the sewer pipe. “The Deep Blue section of Strand Beach was closed due to an electrical fault at the pump station, but the issue has since been resolved. Small Bay was closed due to a damaged sewer pipe.  “The damaged pipe section was isolated inside the manhole. Sewer flow is being diverted by means of a mobile pump that is running 24 hours,” the City said. The most recent temporary closure, a part of Gordon’s Bay beach, was due to a sewer overflow in the area. This was related to a sewer pump station that tripped because inappropriate materials had been thrown into the local sewer network yet again.  “The pumps are being serviced and mitigation measures have been implemented in the meantime to maintain the sewer operations,” the City said.  City Health will be taking water samples daily for water quality testing until the levels are within the minimum requirement for recreational activities as determined by the National Water Quality Guidelines.
