Cape Town - The City said that it is thrilled to be one of the host cities for the SA20 League and delighted to welcome the contingent of local and international players, supporting staff and fans for what’s shaping up to be an explosive four weeks of twenty-over cricket. This evening, Newlands Cricket Grounds will host the first ever game of the new exciting SA20 League, where local team MI Cape Town will be doing battle in a Cape derby with the Paarl Royals.  “The fact that this evening’s game at Newlands is sold out is testament to the strong cricket fan base in our beautiful city. We would like to call on the passionate Cape Town cricket community to show support for MI Cape Town for all the home games.  “The City of Cape Town services will be deployed to ensure that supporters are able to get to games efficiently while also managing non-event traffic flow,” said the City’s Mayco Member for Safety and Security, JP Smith. The City would like to wish the SA20 League a successful tournament. #OneFamily, are you ready? 😍 It all begins today at fortress Newlands for the Clash of the Cape...
