Another challenging year for South Africans has closed. While 2022 inflicted much of the same mess in terms of service delivery, corruption, misrule, lack of accountability and increasing crime, it also introduced fresh challenges for South Africans. Tough economic conditions meant 2022 was a rough year for people everywhere around the world and this has taken a tremendous toll on the well-being of citizens across the globe. South Africa was not spared. The passing year’s orgy of complications that made news headlines came on top of a legacy of poor governance and economic performance. These problems can be dealt with. But the internal tensions in the ruling party are increasing the instability and economic regression. South Africa can ill afford the ANC’s in-house battles as our democracy is still undeveloped. The lack of effective leadership and factional battles in the ANC is one of the main causes for the deterioration, and this decline reinforces the warning signs of a “failed state” surfacing. If the ANC does not realistically manage its internal conflicts and battles and the danger from within, a catastrophe of the ANC’s own creation, then coalitions will be the new form of government. The ANC’s power games need to stop and President Cyril Ramaphosa must deliver on his “new dawn” promises. * Mohamed Saeed, Pietermaritzburg.  ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
