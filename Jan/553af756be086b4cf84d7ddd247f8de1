Cape Town - The Cape Town Carnival is set to brighten the streets of the Mother City on March 18, with this year’s theme being “Afr’Energy”, which symbolises the power of South Africans to work together and make the dream of a better world a reality. In preparation for this joyous and colourful celebration, organisers hosted a media launch on Thursday where guests and the media were given a visual display of what awaits the public. This iconic parade is set to return to Green Point’s Somerset Road during the afternoon so that spectators can safely enjoy pre-event activities, with the main parade starting at 7pm. Carnival crew and participating groups are hard at work preparing floats, finalising costumes and honing their performance skills. The event promises to be a spectacular show from 48 community groups across the City ranging from Masiphumelele drummers to the Western Province Marching Band. Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said: “The Cape Town Carnival is a vibrant and unmissable experience for all residents and the many visitors to our city. “From the floats to performances, this event is a celebration of individual creativity, ingenuity and diversity. “We are looking forward to this year’s carnival bringing spectacular colour and life to Cape Town’s streets once more,” Hill-Lewis said. According to the organisers of the event, locals and visitors will be able to join in the festivities for free on the sidelines. Those who prefer to enjoy the spectacle within the placed stand along the parade route can purchase tickets. Tickets for Cape Town Carnival seats are on sale now.
