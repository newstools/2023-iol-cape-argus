Cape Town - Police confiscated five unlicensed guns in various areas of Mitchells Plain in the days leading into the New Year. Several suspects between the ages of 31 and 48 from Mandalay, Lentegeur and Mitchells Plain are expected to appear in the local magistrate’s court after tip-offs from the public led to their arrests. They are expected to be charged with the possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition. Meanwhile, a joint operation between Provincial Kidnapping Task Team, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks), Provincial Organised Crime Investigation, Crime Intelligence and the Hostage Negotiation Team resulted in the arrest of three suspects. The men, aged 30, 32 and 37, were arrested following discovery of the bodies of 48-year-old and 52-year-old Chinese nationals.  The victims, who were later identified as brothers, were found in Khayelitsha on December 26 and 28 respectively and rushed to the Khayelitsha District Hospital. The police said their preliminary investigations suggest that the brothers were abducted in the Mowbray area on Thursday, December 22 at about 10.45pm. Provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembisile Patekile praised the efforts made by the integrated forces for their excellent investigation and for bringing the perpetrators to book. “Kidnapping and extortion are on top of the priority list in the Western Cape and we will make sure that the perpetrators of these crimes get their day in court,” said Patekile. The suspects are scheduled to appear in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court facing charges relating to murder, attempted murder, kidnapping and extortion. siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
