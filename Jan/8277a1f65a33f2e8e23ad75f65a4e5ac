Cape Town - The family of shack fire victims from Khayelitsha have appealed to the Cape Town community to assist with their burial. Sesethu Matiwane, 37, died alongside her 10-month-old son, Imolathile, when her and her life partner Lizo Ntaba’s shack caught fire on December 26 at the “Level 2” informal settlement in Khayelitsha. Matiwane is survived by two daughters, aged 15 and 16. Nobuntu Matiwane said about her niece: “I heard about the incident from my son, he called me around 6am that day telling me to rush here because my niece has passed on together with her son. “As an elder of the family I am unemployed and I don’t have any means whatsoever. I hope someone can assist us with the burial together with the DNA money that we urgently need,” said Nobuntu. According to the family, arrangements to bury the mother and her son had also been delayed by the police’s DNA backlog, and without the ability to positively identify the fire victims, or pay for a private company to undertake the test, their burial had to be halted.  Both bodies are held at Tygerberg State Mortuary. The family have not yet confirmed the day of the burial due to problems at hand. Anyone who is willing to assist can call the aunt on 060 598 9465 or transfer as little as they can into the Capitec account under MS SN MATIWANE 1439016761. siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
