EDUCATION MEC David Maynier has congratulated the matric teachers and principal of Hector Peterson Secondary School on a 14.1% increase in the 2022 pass rate from 2021’s. Maynier visited the Wallacedene school on Friday morning to celebrate the release of the individual 2022 National Senior Certificate Results to candidates. “The school has produced excellent results this year, despite the surrounding community facing so many challenges,” Maynier said.  “They achieved an incredible 92.6% pass rate in the 2022 matric exams – a whopping 14.1 percentage point increase from last year.” Moreover, 55% of their candidates achieved Bachelor passes – up from 40.2% last year, and they did this while increasing the number of candidates writing from 204 to 229. “We congratulate principal Mike Mavovana and the matric teachers of Hector Peterson Secondary School, and thank them for the support they have given their learners,” Maynier said. “And we especially congratulate Hector Peterson Secondary School’s matric class of 2022: they have shown incredible grit and determination, and should be very proud of their achievement,” the MEC said.

He said gone were the days when it was assumed that Metro East would be at the bottom of the district log, as they were now knocking on the door of 80%, and closing the inequality gap that schools in areas with difficult socio-economic circumstances faced. “We also congratulate Overberg, Cape Winelands, and Metro Central Education districts for increasing their pass rates, and Metro North Education District for claiming the top spot at 85.46%. Well done to director Wendy Horn and team,” he said. The district results are as follows: Maynier said there was good news regarding the inequality gap from the quintile results for no-fee schools. “Our quintile 1 schools raised their pass rate 2 percentage points to 70.8%, beating quintile 2 schools. And our quintile 3 schools also increased their pass rate by 0.3 percentage points, to 76.1%.  “These schools are rapidly closing the gap on higher quintiles,” the MEC said. “We are also delighted that the number of under-performing schools – schools that have achieved below 60% in the exams – has declined this year, from 38 in 2021 to 30 in 2022.  “We work hard with our under-performing schools, so it is great to see this number declining.” Maynier also stressed that for those candidates that did not achieve their desired results, to apply for a re-mark or re-check if they do not feel their results reflect their performance, or to write the supplementary exams in June.  More information on these options is available on the WCED website. He also reminded those who disappointed with their results, that there are measures in place to receive counselling and this can be done either by approaching their school (which will put them in touch with the relevant people in the district offices), or by phoning the Safe Schools Hotline - 0800 45 46 47. He again congratulated that Class of 2022 for the “fantastic set of achievements of which we can all be very proud” and encourage all learners who did not pass their exams to “not to give up and to continue doing whatever they can to complete Grade 12”. Candidates can collect their results from their schools today, 20 January 2022. They are also available on the WCED website: https://wcedonline.westerncape.gov.za/ Cape Argus
