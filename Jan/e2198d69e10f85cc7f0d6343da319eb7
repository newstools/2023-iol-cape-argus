Cape Town - Friends and colleagues of activist Ntsikelelo Msweswe from Gugulethu have remembered him after he was gunned down with two of his friends on January 14. Msweswe, 34, played a huge role in uplifting the unemployed youth of Gugulethu. He was one of the men killed in Gugulethu NY112 when gunmen burst into a home and shot three people dead and left one injured. Director of unemployed movement Organising For Work (OFW), Pamela Silwana, founder of the OFW, Ayal Belling, and founder of Prime Candidate U, Marina Hall, described Msweswe as a selfless man who became the most active volunteer for the movement in 2019.  Silwana said: “Through his dedication he then became a co-ordinator of the same organisation in an effort to highlight the plight of unemployed people in Gugulethu. “Ntsikelelo was a very bubbly person; he came from a very struggling background but that did not stop him from making a change in our community. We worked together every day and he was upbeat. He wanted to help someone, and I think in his way he wanted people to know that anything is possible. “He was a great friend and a good activist. There’s so much that he did, and I don’t want people not to know that about him because he played a big role and made a lot of difference.” Silwana said her friend also had his faults as he was released from prison at the age of 22 but managed to turn his life around by bettering himself. “Sometimes if you are from the township and you see the hardships that people go through, (it's no excuse) sometimes you turn into crime but Ntsikelelo is a very good example of change. He made sure that we will never remember him as a criminal but as someone who made change and changed people's lives” said Silwana. Msweswe left behind his twin daughters aged 12 year siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
