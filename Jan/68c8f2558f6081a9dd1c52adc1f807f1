Cape Town - The gift of a new minibus was greeted with smiles and gratitude by the staff at Noluthando School and Sheltered Employment Trust for the Deaf and Autistic in Khayelitsha. Their new set of wheels will help Noluthando School (as its commonly known) with its daily tasks. Pick n Pay founder Raymond Ackerman and his wife Wendy handed over the set of keys for the new Volkswagen minibus to the school’s principal Ayanda Ncinane. Last year he had requested a smaller vehicle to transport the school’s students. Ncinane approached Wendy late last year after the realisation that the school spent more money on transport each month due to using a school bus for everyday errands. From being part of the school’s growth since 2014 and having to implement good change since then, Wendy took it to her husband, sharing her thoughts of receiving a minivan as a birthday present and donating it. “Some children live far away from the school and it is too expensive to use the big bus for just a few children due to the petrol costs. “The principal managed to express the need for a smaller car to fetch these children,” she said. While addressing members of the school’s board Wendy mentioned that the person they should be thanking is her husband because he is the one who bought the van on her behalf. Operations Manager at Noluthando Sheltered Employment Trust, Andrea Van Wyk said they were very excited to learn that a vehicle was being donated to their use “There are not many transport companies willing to enter Khayelitsha and those who do are very expensive. We would like to thank Mr and Mrs Ackerman. “This vehicle will open new doors of opportunity for our beneficiaries and will be a catalyst for their development" said Van Wyk. siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
