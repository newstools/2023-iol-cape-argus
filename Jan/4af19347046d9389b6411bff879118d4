Cape Town - A Khayelitsha community leader and former councillor, Ryder Mkutswana, and small business owners in the township have come together to ensure that a family of three who lost their lives in a shack fire more than three weeks ago will get a dignified burial. Wendy Matiwane, her partner Lizo Ntaba and their son Imolathile Matiwane died in a fire at the “Level 2” informal settlement on December 26, 2022. Matiwane’s older children, who are still underaged, appealed for donations on social media to help bury their mother, her boyfriend and their youngest sibling. Having heard of the appeal, Mkutswana approached business owners around the area to come to the family’s aid.In preparation for the funeral, which will take place today, Mpumzi Mange donated R15 000 on behalf of Khayelitsha Community Trust (KTC) with each victim getting R5 000. Food was provided by a local supermarket which will send food parcels to the Matiwane and Ntaba families. Lilitha Matiwane expressed gratitude to everyone who went over and above to make sure that her late mother and brother will be buried in a dignified manner. “I would like to thank you all for making time to go out there seeking help on our behalf. This means a lot and I promise when things look up for me, I will also add value to this community,” she said. Mkutswana also extended his gratitude to those he approached as he promised to use the same process he use when asking for donations. “On behalf of the family, I would like to thank you all. I promise to send letters to everyone of you just to say thank you,” he said. siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
