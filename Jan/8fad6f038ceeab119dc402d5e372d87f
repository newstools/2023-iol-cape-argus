Cape Town - The City of Cape Town’s water and sanitation directorate will be undertaking planned work in various areas across the city. The planned work will result in water supply disruptions in the communities. According to the City, the department of water and sanitation will be conducting zero-pressure testing as part of the installation process for pressure management technology. The routine operation forms part of the City’s water demand management strategy. Managing water pressure more effectively reduces the possibility of pipe bursts and water wastage, and tests are carried out to see if any unmapped inflows need to be considered before installing smart pressure-reducing valves, the City said. Cape Town residents living in the affected areas may experience low water pressure, and some may have no water coming out of their taps during this testing period, and according to the department, it is impossible to predict which areas or streets will experience disruptions. However, the following communities have been identified areas that will most likely be affected during the operation, Burgundy Estate, Strand, Sir Lowry’s Pass, Sonstraal Heights, Vredekloof Heights and Belami Ridge, Goedemoed, The Crest and Rosedale Estate. The City of Cape Town’s acting Mayco member for water and sanitation, Siseko Mbandezi, said the City sincerely regrets any inconvenience, but it is imperative that it maintains and upgrades its water supply infrastructure to benefit its consumers. “Residents who experience continued outages after the tests are concluded can contact the City,” he said. To avoid being severely affected by the operation, the City is encouraging residents to store water in clean sealed containers for domestic use during this period. Taps are to be kept closed to prevent any water loss and/or damage when the water supply is restored.
