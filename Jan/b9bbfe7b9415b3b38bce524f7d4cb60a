Cape Town - A traditional homecoming celebration ceremony in Gugulethu turned into a nightmare over the weekend when assailants gatecrashed the event and shot and killed three people. The celebration was to welcome back a young man who had undergone the month-long traditional Xhosa rite of passage into manhood. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said police responded to a mass murder on Saturday at around 22:50 in NY112 where three men were shot and killed.  “A fourth victim was shot and wounded and admitted to hospital for treatment,” he said. Traut said two of the victims were aged 38 and 40, while the third victim’s age was unknown. “The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation and arrests are yet to be made and it was too soon to speculate about a possible motive,” he said. Any person who can shed light on the case is kindly requested to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111, or use the mobile application My SAPS. Traut said Information will be treated confidentially.
