Cape Town - A tribute concert has been planned for the late Just US Band bassist and vocalist Bentley Marcus Brown, who recently passed away. Brown died on New Year’s Day and the Swingers Lounge in Wetton will host the concert with a host of musicians participating on Sunday at 6pm. The proceeds from the concert, made from the R50 entry fee for each person, would be donated to Brown’s family. Swingers Lounge owner Kevin Harris said Brown and the Just US resident band entertained the patrons for more than a decade. Harris said Brown started attending the Swingers at age 16 and was eager to learn from experienced musicians. However, he got his break years after, when the leader of the band Nazeem Brown noticed his enthusiasm and his talent as a bassist and he eventually allowed him to join the band. On that fateful Saturday night, Harris said the club was a house full of musicians when he was called up. Harris said Brown was always willing to allow younger musicians to play with the band on stage. He said Brown had left big shoes to fill. Organiser Ben Hector said: “A couple of names have been dropped and several prominent bands have confirmed attendance. On the night the musicians would share their experiences with Bentley and tribute a song to him.” Brown would be laid to rest at Kraaifontein Cemetery on Tuesday next week. Cape Argus
