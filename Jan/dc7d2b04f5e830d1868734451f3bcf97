Pretoria – South Africans on Tuesday woke up to the sad news of the fatal shooting of the 8-year-old tiger, Sheba, after it escaped from its enclosure in Walkerville, south of Joburg. A wide-scale operation, tracking the feline, soon grabbed local and international news headlines after the big cat viciously attacked 37-year-old William Mokoena, landing him in hospital. Sheba also mauled other animals including dogs and a pig, fuelling heightened interest among social media users and dominating public discourse. In typical South African style, the sadness, anger and gloom over the killing of the big was soon replaced with jest, memes and humour, as social media processed the demise of Sheba. The nickname “Jungle Oats” soon topped the trends, as more and more users linked the slain feline to the tiger proudly displayed on the popular cereal brand produced by Tiger Brands.

He said the feline was put down after it had entered a farm with six dwellings of families living there. It attacked and killed a domestic animal. “On Wednesday (today) morning around 1.55am, reports were received of activity on the Arboretum Farm in Walkers Fruit Farms. This location is 2km from where the tiger Sheba was last known to be roaming,” Mandy said. “She had entered a farm area with six dwellings, with families living there. Sheba attacked and killed one of the domestic animals and a call was made for urgent assistance.” Members of the tracking team responded to the scene and began to track the tiger. The owner of the tiger was present, and the tiger was located near one of the houses on the farm. “Due to the terrain and area, it was not possible to contain her or secure her safely. At 3.45am the decision was made to euthanise her while it was still safe to do so,” Mandy said. “Unfortunately, at that moment in time, darting her was not an option. Sheba had moved during the night across the hills to the west side of Fruit Farms, bringing her close to livestock and others residents in a more densely populated area. “This was not an easy decision to make at the time and the safety of the community of Walkers Fruit Farms was a priority.” Meanwhile, William Mokoena, the man recuperating in hospital after he was attacked on Saturday night by a female tiger, has appointed top lawyer Zola Majavu to represent him against the owner of the feline.
