Cape Town - Phumlani Banzana, a 29-year-old general worker for VVF – a chemical manufacturing company in Montague Gardens – has been denied his bail appeal by the Western Cape High Court. Banzana, who has yet to stand trial, was denied bail by the Simon’s Town Magistrate’s Court in July last year, and filed for an appeal at the high court. He had been charged with aggravated robbery, but two more counts were added to his sheet. Banzana claimed he had been visiting a friend in Simon’s Town when he was apprehended. The State however had proof that he had been one of two men who robbed three Ethiopian nationals (complainant) at a grocery store in Fish Hoek. They tracked the complainant’s mobile device and found Banzana in possession of the stolen goods. During his appeal, Banzana stated that he had been shot five times at the time of his arrest and taken to Groote Schuur Hospital for his injuries. The father of three had injuries to his abdomen, arm, finger, leg and waist. “He was taken to hospital on the same day, discharged on July 27, 2022 and kept at the Fish Hoek police station until he appeared before court at the behest of his attorney on August 2,” the judgment reads. Regardless, Banzana was denied his bail appeal by the court as Judge Alma de Wet was of the view that his personal circumstances, including his medical condition, did not sufficiently give reasonable grounds for his release on bail. “The appellant’s complaint is in my view somewhat opportunistic as he and/or his legal representative – had they believed that the appellant was unlawfully detained after his early discharge from hospital – could have employed the appellant’s common law remedy … to ensure his appearance in court,” Acting Judge De Wet said. Banzana remains in custody. rafieka.williams@inl.co.za Cape Argus
