Cape Town - A Nyanga family are grieving the loss of their daughter after she was found dead over the weekend. Elona Sombo, 20, was last seen alive on December 2 when leaving her home in Mau-Mau section, Nyanga. She was wearing a white top and black pants but according to her mother she was found wearing shorts with her legs tied up and her face fractured because of the trauma she faced leading to her death. Sambo’s mother, Lindiwe Macingwane, who is a GBV activist, believes her daughter fell victim soon after her last conversation with her younger sister on December 5, 2022. “I last saw Elona on the day she disappeared but we heard from her three days later. The last conversation she had with her younger sister was that she was at a guest house but planning to return home soon.” The family said Elona was reported missing shortly after her disappearance and they did all they could to find her. “I spent the whole of December looking for her, I went to the last place she was seen in Khayelitsha and I spoke to her friends but nothing came of that.  “During this whole time people kept advising me to go to Tygerberg morgue and I refused and that is because I could not gather my thought around the idea of her being no more,” said Lindiwe. Being a believer of God, Lindiwe believes that whoever is capable of causing harm to her daughter will face the consequences of their actions. “As much as I want the law to play its part, I know God will never forsake me.  “I am grateful that I will be able to bury my child because a lot of mothers out there are longing for closure when it comes to their children”. She concluded Police did not respond to queries at the time of going to press. siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
