Cape Town - This weekend South Africa will be taking on the netball powerhouses of Australia, England and New Zealand in a quad series that serves as a curtain-raiser of sorts before this year’s Netball World Cup in July. The four-day tournament, hosted at the CTICC, takes places from Saturday and concludes on Wednesday. Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the Mother City was pleased to host the four teams, in partnership with Netball South Africa. “Tournaments like the quad series provide both an economic boost to our city and the perfect opportunity for teams to refine their game plans ahead of the Netball World Cup, set to take place in Cape Town later this year. “On behalf of the City, it is my pleasure to warmly welcome the South African, New Zealand, Australian and English netball teams to the Mother City. We are thrilled to host you in our beautiful city,” said Hill-Lewis. All teams will be in action daily with games at 4pm and 6pm on tournament days. South Africa, ranked No 5 in the world, will kick off the tournament against New Zealand, ranked No 2, on Saturday, before top-ranked Australia plays against world No 3 England in the later match. Cultural Affairs and Sport MEC Anroux Marais met the Spar Proteas team and wished them well ahead of the tournament’s start. “Thank you for all that you are doing to promote women’s sports in our country. We are very proud to be able to support you in the Mother City and we hope to see you lift both trophies at the end of the quad and World Cup events,” she said. Cape Argus
