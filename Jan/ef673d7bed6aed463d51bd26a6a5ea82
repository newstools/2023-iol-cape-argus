Cape Town - The new Klapmuts High School has received sanitary towels from Human Nature Community Project, a registered NGO from Mbekweni. Teacher Thandokazi Mrhali accepted the donation on behalf of the girls. Human Nature Community Project founder Shane Titana and his team visited the school on Tuesday. “Since we started, we have donated more than 20000 sanitary towels to community members and schools in Mbekweni.  “From around the area, schools such as Langabuya Primary School, Imboniselo Primary School and Mbekweni Higher Primary have benefited from this initiative. “Market research shows that there are young girls who do not attend schools on a monthly basis due to a lack of sanitary towels. We believe a girl child’s right to education should not be compromised because they are girls and that is how the organisation came about,” said Titane. This NGO was launched in 2019 partnering with Asiphe Kamte, Nwabisa Mvula and Dumisani Bolani in Mbekweni. After the successful drive, Titane and his team are planning to embark on other projects, also focusing on bettering lives of unprivileged students. “Upon visiting the schools, we saw there was a dire need for school uniforms, school shoes and stationery. The shocking and unhygienic state of some school toilets also caught our attention,” said Titane.
