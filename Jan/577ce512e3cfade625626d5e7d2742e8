Cape Town - The South African International Ballet Competition (SAIBC) is set to honour those who contributed to the world of ballet while celebrating its 10-year anniversary in the coming months. The competition, which will take place at the Artscape Opera House from July 23 to 26, will be presented as a hybrid event, offering ballet and dance lovers exciting options. Making an announcement about the two added categories to the event, SAIBC CEO Dirk Badenhorst said: “We are starting the SAIBC recognition awards looking at lifetime achievement awards and ambassadors of ballet in South Africa and beyond. “Development teachers are often forgotten. We see a star somewhere, forgetting about the hours that are put in before we get to witness the young star. “The second category will be the new choreography division which is forming a hopeful part of the bigger plan that I have to ensure that we are trying to take more of South Africa’s choreography, non-classical and new classical, to the world,” he said. Sharing a message from the Minister of Cultural Affairs and Sports, Carol van Wyk said: “The Western Cape government has proudly supported this event over the years and we recognise the importance of dance and performing arts. “The creative sector is one that plays a crucial role in society but is often sadly unclaimed. “Through supporting our young people to participate in the arts and take part in competitions, we can create safe spaces for them in which they can grow their talent and work towards their success.” Those who will be attending the competition are promised performances from traditional ballet classics like Cinderella to outdoor performances at Maynardville, moving tribute productions like Dreaming Dance in District Six – the Johaar Mosaval Story” and the annual SAIBC ballet. siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
