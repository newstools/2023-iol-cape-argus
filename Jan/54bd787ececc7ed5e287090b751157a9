Cape Town - While many South Africans are still seething and unimpressed with the insistent load shedding, some have taken to asking the ‘universe’ for a better deal than having to turn to candles to light their homes. On Sunday evening Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, a renowned doctor, author, broadcaster and United Nations special rapporteur, posted a light-hearted tweet, calling on South Africans to stop using the burning candle emoji in the meantime and instead use other emojis to manifest or for other purposes. The burning candle emoji found in emoticons packs across most social media platforms has become synonymous with manifestation texts and posts. South Africa is currently on load shedding Stage 6 following the breakdown of eleven generators amounting to 5 084MW of capacity on Tuesday morning, January 10.  Electricity service provider Eskom made the announcement on Wednesday, saying that until further notice the country would remain on Stage 6. In her original tweet, Mofokeng, whose handle is @drtlaleng, tweeted: “Maybe we should stop using these “🕯” it seems the universe is misunderstanding South Africans.” Maybe we should stop using these “🕯” it seems the universe is misunderstanding South Africans. 🫶🏾 In true South African fashion, many Twitter users recognised the crafty and witty critique on the increasing hours they have been left in the dark due to load shedding. Dozens of Twitter users retweeted, liked and commented with funny and quirky statements about how they might have indirectly manifested load shedding by virtue of posting and texting using the burning candle emoji as South Africans. One Twitter user commented, “Even "🔥" might give the universe the wrong idea Prof.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Even "🔥" might give the universe the wrong idea Prof🤣🤣🤣🤣 Another tweeted, “This could well be my fault - I'm so sorry, I've been using them in multiples! 🕯️🕯️ - 🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️ & 🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️ 🤣😉” This could well be my fault - I'm so sorry, I've been using them in multiples! 🕯️🕯️ - 🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️ & 🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️ 🤣😉 “ 🕯 🕯 We've been manifesting load shedding on the low low 😩😩🤣🤣” 🕯 🕯 We've been manifesting load shedding on the low low 😩😩🤣🤣 Read more of the responses Dr Mofokeng’s tweet received: ⚡⚡ A better South Africa ⚡⚡🥺 We kinda invited loadshedding and said the 🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️🕯️ are ready😂😂 🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/41wQ5NyZmK Actually 😂😂😂😂 Meanwhile, a national shutdown may be looming as on Sunday fed-up residents and political parties took to social media to express their anger over the worsening power outages and the big electricity price hike. “National Shutdown” was trending on Twitter as angry South Africans vented frustration at disruptions to business, health, service delivery, food wastage and more. “StandUpSA” was another trend that people were rallying behind, created by Twitter user @khustazm, who said an Eskom protest was in the works and volunteers were coming in huge numbers to organise it.  A protest was planned for February 2 from Sunninghill Taxi rank to Eskom’s Megawatt Park in Sandton, while plans were also being made to protest in Cape Town. Cape Argus
