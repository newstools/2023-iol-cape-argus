Cape Town - Several artworks by Africans from across the continent adorn the walls of the illustrious Mount Nelson Belmond Hotel, for a new exhibition, ahead of the 10th annual Investec Cape Town Art Fair. The exhibition Today, I wish to talk to your dreams, curated by Amogelang Maledu, can be found displayed in areas of the hotel, from the reception, lobby, lounge, Planet Bar and hallways. The show was privately launched at the hotel on Wednesday. Maledu said the exhibition consisted of works by 18 contemporary African artists. “African futurism was also very important as a useful concept that informed the thinking of the works on display but also the spatiality of this historical hotel,” Maledu said. “I was thinking through African futurism, history, thinking of the present, thinking of futures and artists that really speak to the embedding of the historical present where all of these moments meet – the future, the past, and the present, so that’s really what informed the bringing of the artworks into this space.” Hotel general manager Tiago Sarmento referred to the launch as a special moment for the hotel, and said the exhibition saw the injection of African DNA into the hotel. “I really wish that you can enjoy just a little sample of what’s to come in the next few years as we reimagine the ‘Pink Lady’,” Sarmento said. Investec Cape Town Art Fair director Laura Vincenti said this was the first partnership between the two institutions. The Investec Cape Town Art Fair is scheduled to run from February 17 to 19 at the CTICC, bringing together 99 exhibitors and 23000 visitors. shakirah.thebus@inl.co.za Cape Argus
