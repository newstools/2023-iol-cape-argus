Cape Town - The Department of Transport and Public Works has put out a notice about the coming construction that will take place on Clarence Drive (R44) between the Grill Shack (km 53.5) and Steenbras Dam Mountain Pass (km 56.5). From February 6 to February 21 motorists are advised to use alternative routes where possible. The road, recognised as a scenic route between Gordon’s Bay and Rooi Els, will be closed every day except for Sundays for emergency slope stabilisation repairs. Stop-and-go controls will be in place on Sundays and between 6pm and 8am on every other day of the week. During the time of construction, access to the Grill Shack will only be possible from the Rooi Els side. The department’s head of communication, Jandre Bakker, said the slopes above this section of R44 seemed to be unstable following heavy rains experienced on December 11 and 12. “We know that residents and visitors enjoy using this scenic road between Gordon’s Bay and Rooi Els. For that reason, we assessed the safety of the road and decided to allow single-lane traffic on Clarence Drive during the festive season. “Now that the holidays are over, we are undertaking slope stabilisation repairs in order to restore full two-way traffic along this important road. A stop-and-go will be in place between 6pm and 8am during construction.” The slope repair is scheduled to be completed by March 19. siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
