Cape Town - The court appearances of “Terrible Josters” gang leader Elton Lenting and 19 others may end this year. Lenting appeared in the Western Cape High Court alongside 18 of his 19 co-accused on Wednesday as one of his co-accused couldn’t appear due to a health concern. State prosecutor, Peter John Damon, said he hoped Tuesday would proceed without complications. Elton Lenting was alleged to have led the “Terrible Josters” in criminal gang activity from March 2002 up until January 2017.  He has been accused of murdering several people during his time as the leader. Judge James Lekhuleni postponed the matter, saying police officers had to attend a “dress rehearsal” in preparation for the State of the Nation Address (Sona). Lenting and his co-accused were charged with multiple counts of murder for killing several people between 2013 and 2016.  The State alleged people killed by the accused were shot with firearms. The deceased include Franklin Christopher, Siphokazi Mahlapi, Ricardo Simons, Franklin Prince, Deborah Theresa Solomons and others.  In addition, the accused have been charged with 20 counts of attempted murder. rafieka.williams@inl.co.za Cape Argus
