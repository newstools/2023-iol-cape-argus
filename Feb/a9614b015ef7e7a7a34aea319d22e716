Johannesburg - The Springboks will kick-off a bumper 2023 season against Eddie Jones’ Wallabies in Pretoria in July in the shortened Rugby Championship, and will face Argentina in Johannesburg in their final match on home soil before the build-up to the Rugby World Cup. In August, the Boks will travel to Argentina to take on the Pumas before facing Wales and the All Blacks in World Cup warm-up matches in Cardiff and London in the final build-up to the global showpiece in France, which kicks off in the second weekend in September. The Boks kick off their season on July 8 against Australia at Loftus Versfeld before travelling to New Zealand to face the All Blacks on July 17. They will return to South Africa to wrap up their Championship campaign against the Pumas at Emirates Airline Park on July 29.

Director of Rugby Rassie Erasmus added that the match against the Pumas in Argentina ties in nicely with their RWC preparations: “Playing against Argentina in South America is unique as they have a very passionate home crowd that brings the best out of their team, so that environment will serve as good preparation for our team with an eye on the World Cup, especially after getting a taste of the atmosphere we can expect at the international extravaganza in our match against France in Marseille last November.” Lucky enough to call this my job, says groom-to-be Eben Etzebeth on SA Rugby award Nienaber said the national coaches have been hard at work with their planning: “The coaches have hit the ground running this year and we’ll continue to put in the hard yards to ensure that we leave no stone unturned before the World Cup.” An announcement on the venues of the Tests in New Zealand and Argentina, as well as the Boks’ training camps will be made in due course.
