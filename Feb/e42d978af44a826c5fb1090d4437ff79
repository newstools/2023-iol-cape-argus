Cape Town - The Cape Town ePrix is almost upon us and South African driver Kelvin van der Linde is confident a successful event in the Mother City â€˜will naturally lead to the Formula One hype getting biggerâ€™. The last time South Africa held a F1 race was 30 years ago in 1993. In recent months the rumours have been rife that there would be a race in 2023, but when this yearâ€™s race schedule was released Mzansi wasnâ€™t on the list. Saturdayâ€™s ePrix will then be the perfect opportunity for the country to put themselves in a strong position to show that they can run a world-class FIA event.

I think that will only naturally lead in to the Formula One hype getting bigger. It is obviously a FIA run event, and it is the first ... lets say full on FIA event in the motorsport circles at least for car racing.
