Cape Town - Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu, NSFAS CEO Andile Nongogo and other sponsors hosted a group of pupils who matriculated last year. The group, beneficiaries of Social Development grants, were given a pat on the back for passing against all odds. The event, held at GovChat in the city on Tuesday evening, was aimed at celebrating post matriculant students who come from difficult backgrounds and are relying on Sassa.  The former pupils were given laptops, dignity packs and other items to take home. Zulu said: “Having NSFAS here is much more exciting for me because one of the things that I would like to see is for these children who are Sassa grant beneficiaries to automatically get the sponsorship to go and study further. “These are children who come from single parent-headed households, brought up by grandparents and who are entirely depending on social grants but are succeeding against all odds. “It is odd having to grow in an environment of poverty, where you don’t know where your next meal will come from, where the money that the grandparents or mother has, is the only money that comes from government in support as a grant.” Nongogo said: “NSFAS exist through government to fund poor students who do not have the means to go to tertiary institutions and sometimes we end there, leaving the most important part so that you can ultimately contribute to the economy either by being employed or become an entrepreneur.  “However that only happens when you do your part as a student.” Sassa CEO Totsie Memela encouraged the pupils, saying: “Faith, focus and follow through.” siviwe.melapi@inl.co.za Cape Argus
