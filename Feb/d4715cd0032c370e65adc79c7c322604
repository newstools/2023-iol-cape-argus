Your Opinion Page article: “Reality of youth inequality” (Cape Argus, February 6) is the first of five, and I’m sure many readers will follow the series avidly, because of the vital role our youth can play in saving our country from its downward slide. The authors correctly point out that any inequality of “stimulation, nourishment, and care” will generally carry on for most of the child’s life, and that “enabling environments” are necessary to help those without access to resources. Sounds like a better use for R1 billion than the Spurs! And if the government is serious about dealing with inequality, some of the money should be spent on a Planned Parenthood campaign. This would make people aware that they could be condemning their children to inequality if they have them before they are financially ready – so many poor families work two jobs, and don’t have the time to stimulate and care for their unplanned children. And the sheer numbers of children are overwhelming the teachers, who are forced to treat them as groups, without being able to focus on individuals – this while individual recognition is apparently vital for personal growth. One thing that inequality should teach us, is to look at those who are doing well, and learn from them – first establishing work security, and then small families, is one way towards more healthy, stimulated children. * Rob Johnston, Tokai. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
