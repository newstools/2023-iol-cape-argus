Cape Town - Parliament’s presiding officers, Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula and National Council of Provinces (NCOP) chairperson Amos Masondo have spoken of their shock and distress at the sudden death of ANC NCOP delegate Maurencia Gillion. Gillion died suddenly on Tuesday afternoon while attending the first day of an NCOP training workshop at the Cape Town City Lodge. Speaker MapisaNqakula and Masondo, who were also attending the workshop, said Gillion suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness during the afternoon session and that she died on the spot, following unsuccessful attempts to resuscitate her. In a joint condolence statement on behalf of their parliamentary colleagues at the workshop, they said: “All of us are in a state of great grief, inexplicable shock and anguish. Nothing could have prepared any of us here for this. To lose an MP is very sad, but to lose her in this manner is just harrowing.” Meanwhile, the Western Cape ANC has announced a week-long mourning period to mark the life and passing of Gillion, who was its former provincial deputy secretary. Provincial spokesperson Sifiso Mtsweni remembered Gillion as having been known for her forthrightness and wit, as well as her passion for rural development and women’s rights. “She raised issues pertaining to the transformation of our society into a better life for all with pernicious vigour. She stood for the poor and downtrodden. She was well known for her activism for farm dwellers and farmworkers.” mwangi.githahu@inl.co.za Cape Argus
